# ModularGripper

![ModularGripper](project.jpg)

This project has CAD model file required to make a Modular Gripper. 

Development of reliable, lightweight prosthetic gripper that can perform a power grasp and precision grasp of test objects. The gripper is prototyped using 3D printing technology and Hybrid deposition manufacturing technique. Several design strategies are implemented and investigated to achieve a robust design capable of grasping everyday objects which have different form factors.
 
The final design is in the video which demonstrates the ability of gripper to perform true dexterity i.e. both precision grasp as well as power grasp (form grasp) using only one motor. This design, not only performs well but also is lightweight. It consists of 26 3d printed PLA plastic parts, making it a modular design. The design is modeled in Autodesk Inventor and printed using Prusa printers. During the development of this gripper in a fast-paced environment, I have learned troubleshooting 3d printers and optimizing STL files using CURA software. Contact me if you want to know more.
